# Drug-Prediction-on-Patients
In this project we will predict drug for patients according to their health metrics.

### Task 1 : Importing libraries and dataset
Here we imported the libraries and patient data.

Total 200 patient records with information about age, sex, BP, Cholestrol, Na_to_K and Drug given.

### Task 2 : Plotting Graph 
Here we will plot the graph to check graphical data of gender, BP, Cholestrol and drug, Age and Na_to_K.

Male patients are more, BP and cholestrol are high and drugY is used more.

Age group of 35-40 is more and graph for Na_to_K is tallest at 10.

### 2.1 : Drug count prediction
Here we will predict the data for male and female, BP, Cholestrol drug wise, which drug use is more. 
With differnt type of graphs we will predict data for age wise drug usage, Na_to_K drug usage.

DrugY is tallest and drug B is smallest.

### 2.2 : Age and Na_to_K wise prediction
With differnt type of graphs we will predict data for age wise drug usage, Na_to_K drug usage.

Drug Y is used mostly in all age group and Drug B is used in mostly in age group 50-70

Blood sodium to potassium concentration for Drug Y is 15 and above and for Drug B is in between 10 to 15.

### 2.3 : Age and Na_to_K drug wise scatterplot
Here for different drugs different colors are plotted and it shows according to age how much Blood sodium to potassium concentration is there drug wise

Drug Y is used in all age group with sodium to pottasium concentration from 15 and above, Drug B is used in age group 50 to 70 with concentration 10 to 15.

### 2.4 : Drug and Age BP wise graph
Here we will see how drugs are reacting on BP levels age wise

- BP is normal with Drug X for all the age group
- BP is high with Drug Y in age group less than 40 and with Drug A from age 20 to 50 and with Drug B from age 50 to 70,
- BP is mostly low with Drug C and some with Drug X

### Task 3 : Data processing
Here we will process the data for more accuracy.

# Conclusion:
In this project we predicted drug for patients according to their health metrics. Here we compiled data for a study. we have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of five medications. We applied data mining to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness.
According to graph where drug Y is blue, drug C is yellow, drug X is green, drug A is red and drug B is violet.

Below data we concluded:

- Count of Drug Y is more then drug X then drug A and then same for drug B and C.

- Drug Y is used in all age group with sodium to pottasium concentration from 15 and above.

- Drug C age 20 to 60 with concentration 5 to 15.

- Drug X all age group with concentration less than 15.

- Drug A age group 20 to 50 with concentation less than 15.

- Drug B is used in age group 50 to 70 with concentration 10 to 15.

- BP is normal with Drug X for all the age group

- BP is high with Drug Y in age group less than 40 and with Drug A from age 20 to 50 and with Drug B from age 50 to 70,

- BP is mostly low with Drug C and some with Drug X
